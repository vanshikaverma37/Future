                Health Informatics is the bridge between healthcare and
                information technology. It includes managing patient records,
                hospital systems, and health data analytics. After a B.Sc. in
                Health Informatics / Life Sciences + Certification, you can work
                in hospitals, insurance firms, or IT-health companies. Medical
                coding, though non-clinical, is also a high-paying career for
                biology graduates with strong attention to detail.
