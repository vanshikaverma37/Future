                  admission criteria of the school or college you're applying

                  (usually around 60% or more) for Science streams due to the
                  academic load. However, many schools also understand that
                  marks don't define a student's true potential. If you're
                  genuinely interested in Science or Biology and willing to work
                  hard, speak with school counselors—they may allow you based on
